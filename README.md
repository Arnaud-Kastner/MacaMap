## Project Overview
This GitHub repository contains materials for the SAÉ 601 project focusing on "Managing Complex R&T Technical Projects". The project revolves around the development of an interactive weather map capable of displaying temperature variations across the globe over the course of a year. The project requirements, organization, and evaluation criteria are detailed below.

## National Program: Descriptive Sheet
### 1.1 Targeted Skills
- Implementation of technical and regulatory R&T projects in one's activity.
- Management of networking and telecommunications activities in organizational, relational, financial, and commercial terms.

### 1.2 Objectives and Professional Issues
The R&T professional specializing in Network Project Management, when in charge of a complex project involving various R&T technologies, understands both the technical and human resource needs to establish the necessary project environment. They ensure its realization and operation, including in crisis situations (e.g., cybersecurity).

### 1.3 Generic Description
The professional, by demonstrating analytical thinking, responsiveness, and flexibility, must justify and valorize the choices made in project management:
- On the selected technical solution (infrastructure, services, ...)
- On the chosen hardware equipment
- On human resources (selection of collaborators, service providers, possible recruitments based on job descriptions, etc.)
- On the daily project organization, including when facing crisis management (e.g., cyber).

### 1.4 Critical Learning
- Writing a call for tenders or a technical R&T specification
- Technical team leadership
- Coordination of teams on an R&T project or its entirety
- Implementation of efficient R&T technical solutions
- Technical delivery and follow-up of R&T projects
- Rigor in managing an R&T project in its entirety
- Flexibility in team and task management
- Taking responsibility towards teams
- Valorization of deployed solutions, technical offers, or commercial offers
- Proposing innovative and responsible R&T solutions

### 1.5 Mobilized and Combined Resources
- English: Professional Insertion
- Professional Expression-Culture-Communication: Communicating as a future middle manager
- Conduct and valorization of an R&T project

### 1.6 Workload
Workload: to be defined locally by each IUT

## Proposed Project: Weather Map
The primary objective is to develop an interactive map that visualizes temperature variations across the planet throughout the year, similar to the format proposed by Ventusky. Meteorological data will be collected via available online APIs.

This map will offer the functionality to integrate temperature sensors. The data collected by these sensors will be stored historically and viewable directly on the map.

### 2.1 Minimum Final Technical Expectations
- Have a map.
- Integrate a slider on the map to visualize temperature evolution over the year.
- Display temperatures in grid format.
- Allow clicking on the map to retrieve temperature information at a given point.
- Implement a registration/login system for users to register a temperature sensor and view its collected data.
- Develop a "back office" for moderators to verify the coherence of displayed sensor data and to contact the sensor owner via email if coherence is not maintained.
- Include a search bar for easier location searching.

### 2.2 Possible Evolutions
Examples of possible evolutions include:
- Integrating a color gradient on the map with a legend to illustrate temperature ranges.
- Improving the gradient for smoother color transitions.
- Adding other meteorological data (precipitation, wind speed, etc.).
- Implementing a future temperature forecast feature.
- Adding new types of connected objects (e.g., cameras).
- Including a globe view option for a dynamic perspective of global weather.

## Work Organization
The project will be carried out in a professional environment following SCRUM methodology. Teams will operate in sprints, with iterative development cycles. Tasks will be planned in sprint planning meetings, and progress will be reviewed in sprint reviews.

### 3.1 Timeline
See the provided timeline diagram for the SAÉ.

### 3.2 Evaluation
Evaluation will consider factors such as motivation, participation, communication, autonomy, decision-making, technical advancement, and the quality of the final report and oral presentation.
